# Auth0 plugin

To start working with Auth0 in WeWeb, there are two pre-requisites: 

✅ 1- you already have an account with Auth0, it’s free for up to 7,000 active users

✅ 2- you are logged into your Auth0 account

Once that’s done, you'll need to:

1. Connect your Auth0 account
2. Define redirection pages in WeWeb for when users login or logout
3. Define callback URLs in Auth0
4. Trigger signup, login, and logout workflows in WeWeb
5. (optional) Restrict access to pages based on user roles and permissions setup in Auth0 and WeWeb

Follow our [step-by-step guide to Auth0](https://docs.weweb.io/plugins/auth-systems/auth0.html)
